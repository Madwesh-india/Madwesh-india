## 🧠 About Me

I’m an engineer passionate about building intelligent, real-world robotic systems. My experience spans autonomous rover development, swarm robotics, perception pipelines, microcontroller-level optimizations, and scalable system architectures using ROS 2. I specialize in solving robotics problems by bridging low-level control with high-level decision-making—through Python, C++, and applied mathematics.
